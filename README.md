# gobble-stylus-html

Do you prefer stylus to plain CSS? Do you like to use style tags in your HTML?

Well then good news! This [gobble](http://github.com/gobblejs/gobble) plugin will hunt through your HTML sources, find any style tags, use stylus to transpile them to CSS, and dump it back into the tag.
